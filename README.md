> Peer-to-peer encrypted file sharing has never been easier.

[atmospherePro](https://atsign.com/apps/atmospherepro/) makes peer-to-peer
encrypted file sharing possible. In real-time, you can send files across
any device regardless of your location â€” with the added benefit of total
privacy. You can fearlessly share contracts, tax information, or other
confidential information without worrying about your data being stored on
a server in the cloud.

This repo holds the open source code for the atmospherePro app, to serve as
an example of apps that can be build on the atPlatform.

## Developer

The purpose of this repo is primarily to be an example of what can be done
with the atPlatform. So if you're a developer take a look at the code here.
